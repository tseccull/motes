# How to Contribute to MOTES
🌻...First off, skeleton, well done...🌻

Thank you for being here and for your interest in contributing to MOTES.

## Welcome Contributions
- Bug reports.
- Improvements to documentation and the overall user/onboarding experience.
- Instrument I/O modules (i.e. the `/src/motes/io/instrumentio.py` files that 
allow MOTES to read and process spectra observed with different instruments). 
Building your own instrument I/O module and integrating it into MOTES is a 
straightforward process, and a template is provided to assist you. If you'd 
like to discuss integration of your module into the base MOTES package, please
follow the instructions below. 

**In general, feature suggestions will only be considered if they introduce a 
new instrument I/O module or make MOTES easier to use. The core functionality 
of MOTES is considered to be effectively complete.**     

## Engaging in Jolly Cooperation...🌞
In the first instance, any interest in contributing to MOTES should be 
registered by opening an issue in this repo. Keep issues specific and 
manageable in scope. Many issues, each assigned to an individual **actionable**
fix or idea, are easier to tackle than one large issue containing a morass of 
ideas and quasi-related changes that first need to be picked apart. Only 
create a new issue if one does not already exist for a given bug or suggestion.

I am happy to work with you to fix bugs, improve the docs for MOTES, and 
integrate new instrument I/O modules. Let's talk about making MOTES the best 
that it can be.
