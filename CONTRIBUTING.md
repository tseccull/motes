# How to Contribute
First off, skeleton, well done...🌻 Thank you for being here and for 
your interest in contributing to MOTES.

### The following contributions are welcomed:
- Bug reports.
- Improvements to documentation and the overall user/onboarding experience.
- Instrument I/O modules (i.e. the `instrumentio.py` files that allow MOTES to 
read and process spectra observed with different instruments).

**In general, feature suggestions will only be considered if they introduce a 
new instrument I/O module or make MOTES easier to use. The core functionality 
of MOTES is considered to be effectively complete.**     

### Engaging in jolly cooperation...🌞
In the first instance, any initial interest in contributing to the project 
should be made by opening an issue in this repo. I am happy to work with you
to fix bugs, improve the docs for MOTES, and integrate new instrument I/O 
modules. Let's talk about making MOTES the best that it can be.
