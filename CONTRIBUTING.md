# How to Contribute
First off, skeleton, well done...🌻 Thank you for being here and for 
your interest in contributing to MOTES.

### The following contributions are welcomed:
- Bug reports.
- Improvements to documentation and the overall user/onboarding experience.
- Instrument I/O modules (i.e the `instrumentio.py` files that allow MOTES to 
read and process spectra observed with different instruments).

**In general, if your feature suggestion is unrelated to introducing new 
instrument I/O modules or improving MOTES from a user's perspective it
will not be considered. The core functionality of MOTES is considered to be
mostly complete.**     

### Engaging in jolly cooperation...🌞
In the first instance, any initial interest in contributing to the project 
should be made by opening an issue in this repo. I am happy to work with you
to fix bugs, improve the docs for MOTES, and integrate new instrument I/O 
modules. Contributors will receive attribution as co-authors of the software.
