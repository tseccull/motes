# MOTES Code of Conduct

First off, thank you for your interest in contributing to MOTES. The success
of this project, its overall usefulness and its adoption by the astronomical
community, is enhanced by the efforts of each developer that provides their
input. Discussion about MOTES, including its use and development, is strongly
encouraged. We are glad you are here.

We as contributors to MOTES agree to make participation in the project a 
harassment-free experience for everyone, regardless of age, body
size, visible or invisible disability, ethnicity, sex characteristics, gender
identity and expression, level of experience, education, socio-economic status,
nationality, personal appearance, race, religion, or sexual identity
and orientation.

We pledge to act and interact in ways that make this small corner of online
space open, welcoming, diverse, and inclusive. Such an environment is best
suited to the support of our collaborative work.

## Our Standards

Examples of behavior contributing to a positive environment include:

* Collaborating in good faith with a welcoming and inclusive attitude
* Respecting differing viewpoints and experiences
* Gracefully accepting constructive criticism
* Focusing on what is best for the project and all its contributors

Examples of unacceptable behavior include:

* The use of sexualized language or imagery, and sexual attention or
  advances of any kind
* Trolling, insulting or derogatory comments, and personal or political attacks
* Public or private harassment
* Publishing others' private information, such as a physical or email
  address, without their explicit permission
* Other conduct which could reasonably be considered inappropriate in a
  professional setting

## Enforcement Responsibilities

Lead contributors are responsible for clarifying and enforcing our standards of
acceptable behavior and will take appropriate and fair corrective action in
response to any behavior that they deem inappropriate, threatening, offensive,
or harmful.

Lead contributors have the right and responsibility to remove, edit, or reject
comments, commits, code, wiki edits, issues, and other contributions that are
not aligned to this Code of Conduct, and will communicate reasons for moderation
decisions when appropriate.

## Scope

This Code of Conduct applies within all MOTES collaborative interactions, and 
also applies when an individual is officially representing MOTES publicly.
Examples of representing MOTES include use of an official e-mail address,
posting via an official social media account, or acting as an appointed
representative at an online or offline event.

## Enforcement

Instances of abusive, harassing, or otherwise unacceptable behavior may be
reported to Tom Seccull at the email address posted on the home page of 
`tomseccull.com`. All complaints will be reviewed and investigated promptly
and fairly. All lead contributors are obligated to respect the privacy and 
security of the reporter of any incident.

## Enforcement Guidelines

Lead contributors will follow these guidelines in determining
the consequences for any action they deem in violation of this Code of Conduct.
You get two strikes. Time is short. When warranted in serious cases, lead
contributors have the right to reach directly for the ban hammer.


### Strike 1 - Warning (Don't make me tap the sign)

A warning with consequences for continued behavior. No
interaction with the people involved, including unsolicited interaction with
those enforcing the Code of Conduct, for a specified period of time. This
includes avoiding interactions in project spaces and external channels
like social media. Violating these terms may escalate the warning to a 
permanent ban.

### Strike 2 - Permanent Ban

A permanent ban from contributing to MOTES and any sort of public interaction 
with the project.

## Amendments

This is v1.0.0 of the MOTES Code of Conduct. Contributors may suggest 
amendments to it at any time. We aim to ensure that this CoC evolves 
appropriately with both the MOTES project and its contributors.
