## GENERAL PARAMETERS  #########################################################

# Save the extracted spectra?
-SAVE=1

# Plot extracted 1D spectrum?
-PLOT_EXTRACTED_SPECTRUM=1

# EXTRACTION #------------------------------------------------------------------

# SNR Limit at which the code stops adding pixel columns to the current bin. SNR is
# calculated as the summed flux divided by the root sum square of the error values
# associated with that flux.
-SNR_BIN_LIM=500

# This parameter defines the minimum number of good pixels allowed in each spatial row of a
# dispersion bin when defining the localisation bins on the dispersion axis with the
# getbins function. If this threshold is not met getbins will continuing adding dispersion pixel columns
# to the bin until it is.
-COL_BIN_LIM=7

# The multiple of the bin's moffat FWHM along the spatial axis. This is used to
# define the distance from the centre of the moffat profile at which the extraction
# limits should be set. A value in the range 2-2.5 gives best results.
# Upper_extraction_limit = moffat_centre + (FWHM_MULTIPLIER * moffat_fwhm)
# Lower_extraction_limit = moffat_centre - (FWHM_MULTIPLIER * moffat_fwhm)
-FWHM_MULTIPLIER=2.

# The interpolation method to be used when interpolating the extraction limits of the
# source across all the pixel columns in the 2D image based on the positions of the
# extraction limits for each bin.
-INTERP_KIND=linear

# Diagnostic plotting of the Moffat profile fit to the spatial profile of the 2D spectrum
# collapsed along the entire dispersion axis. For the FORS2 spectra this fit is used to
# to localise the spectrum and define the sky regions prior to sky subtraction.
-DIAG_PLOT_COLLAPSED_2D_SPEC=0

# Diagnostic plotting of the Moffat profile fits to each bin in the spectrum.
-DIAG_PLOT_MOFFAT=0

# Diagnostic plotting of the locations of bins determined by the get_bins function
-DIAG_PLOT_BIN_LOC=1

# Diagnostic plotting of the extraction limits on the 2D spectrum
-DIAG_PLOT_EXTRACTION_LIMITS=1

# SKY SUBTRACTION #-------------------------------------------------------------

# Perform sky subtraction?
-SUBTRACT_SKY=1

# SNR Limit at which the script stops adding pixel columns to the current bin when localising the spectrum before sky subtraction. SNR is
# calculated as the summed flux divided by the root sum square of the error values
# associated with that flux.
-SKY_SNR_BIN_LIM=500

# Works the same as ‘-FWHM_MULTIPLER’ except this variable is used to define the
# boundaries between the region of the 2D image containing the spectrum and the background,
# so that the background can be subtracted. ‘2. is strongly recommended for
# faint targets. For bright ones a value of >4 will give best results.
-BG_FWHM_MULTIPLIER=3.0

# Defines method of sky subtraction. Accepts "MEDIAN", "LINEAR",  and "POLY2". 
# MEDIAN takes a straight column by column median of the background regions to subtract the sky. 
# Linear will fit a line with a gradient to the background pixels in a column that will be subtracted to remove the sky. 
# POLY2 does the same as LINEAR, but instead fits a quadratic polynomial.
-SKYSUB_MODE=MEDIAN

# Diagnostic plotting of the sky subtraction of the 2D spectrum
-DIAG_PLOT_SKYSUB=1


# CR MASKING/REMOVAL #---------------------------------------------------------

# Identify cosmic rays?
#-IDENT_CR=1

# Diagnostic plotting of the sky subtraction of the 2D spectrum
#-DIAG_PLOT_CRMASK=1

# Multiplier for sigma-clipping CRs
#-CR_CLIP_STD_MULT=10

# Number of sigma-clip iterations for masking CRs
#-CR_CLIP_ITER=30

# Works the same as ‘-FWHM_MULTIPLER’ except this variable is used to define the
# boundaries between the region of the 2D image containing the spectrum and the background,
# so that cosmic rays can be flagged. Values in the range 1.5-3 are recommended,
# with brighter targets requiring larger values.
#-CR_FWHM_MULTIPLIER=3.0

# Replace values of bad pixels or those affected by cosmic rays after clipping?
-REPLACE_CRBP=1

# Diagnostic plotting of the CR replacement of the 2D spectrum
-DIAG_PLOT_CRREPLACE=1
