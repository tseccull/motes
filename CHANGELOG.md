# Change Log
All notable changes to this package will be documented here. 
This changelog follows the format described 
[here](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/). [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/) is 
followed.

## 0.4.7 2024-02-25
Updates by D. Kiersz

### Added

- Add a rudimentary `pyproject.toml` file, as per https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/reference/build-system/pyproject-toml/

### Changed

- Pip installs required packages from `pyproject.toml` in a single step. Upgrade to Poetry will be done in the future, but the build system uses setuptools.
- Remove instances of `shell: bash -l {0}` and use defaults in a particular runner environment. The Python environment is set up with `actions/setup-python@v5`, and the dependencies are installed in this environment.
- Simplify the flake8 linting step by running one instance of flake8 with all the necessary flags, fed via `.flake8` as per https://flake8.pycqa.org/en/latest/user/configuration.html 
- Flake8 `max-line-length` to 79, as per PEP8.
- Add explicit version requirements to dependences.
- Reduce build variations from `matrix`.

### Fixed

- README.md badge fix.
- Formatting of scripts based on https://peps.python.org/pep-0008/. This relates to `max-line-length` mentioned previously.

## 0.4.6 2024-02-13
Updates by T. Seccull & D. Kiersz

Removed disabled github actions and unneccessary CI/CD components from the repo. A robust linting 
pipeline has been added.

### Added
- `.github/workflows/motes.yml` is a linting pipeline that activates on push and pull requests. It runs flake8,
  pylint, black, and bandit.

### Removed
- `.github/workflows/motes-cicd.yml` has been replaced with `.github/workflows/motes.yml`
- `.github/workflows/labeler.yml` has been removed.
- `.github/workflows/delete-old-runs.yml` has been removed.

## 0.4.5 2024-02-09
Updates by T. Seccull

Running tests on MOTES in its current main branch form to make sure basic functionality is good. 

### Changed
- Tidied up formatting for script comments, function descriptions, the CHANGELOG, and text printing 
  to the screen for consistency and ease of reading in a text editor.
- Converted some `print()` statements in `common.py` to `sys.stdout.write()` for consistency with 
  the rest of MOTES.
 

## 0.4.4 2023-02-16
Updates by D.Kiersz

We are not ready for full CI/CD yet, but this small update is a step in the right direction as it 
introduces a CI pipeline. Deployment to [PyPI](https://pypi.org/) is the end goal, we are unable to 
register new projects at this time.

### Added
- A CI pipeline has been added to the repository. This will run the linting/vurnebility checks 
  against the code on every push to the main branch, but not enforce them for now. This should help 
  improve the quality of the code down the line.
- Added a workflow to remove old workflows.
- Badges to README.md.

### Changed

- Improvement to .gitignore by using a Python template from 
  [gitignore.io](https://www.toptal.com/developers/gitignore).
- Formatted with `black` and `isort` to conform to PEP8.
- Job names in pipelines are more systematic.

## 0.4.3 2023-04-21
Updates by T. Seccull

### Fixed
* A bug was fixed in the `optimal_extraction()` function in `common.py` related to the enforcement 
  of positivity required for the spatial profile when performing optimal extraction as described by 
  Horne (1986). Previously this was misinterpreted as setting the both the spatial profile and its 
  associated data to zero where data pixels were negative. Instead, the enforcement of positivity 
  applies only the the spatial profile. Because, however, the spatial profile in MOTES is a model 
  Moffat PSF, it has no negative values to begin with and positivity therfore does not need to be 
  enforced. The effect of this change will be minimal for spectra of bright targets that have few 
  negative pixels in their spatial profile. This update prevents overestimation of counts in faint 
  regions of the spectrum with higher numbers of negative pixels. 

## 0.4.2 2023-03-05
Updates by D.Kiersz

### Changed
* `inputs` folder to store fits files, change output file format name to include 1D.
* Conversion to docstrings adhering to Google's style guide: 
  https://github.com/google/styleguide/blob/gh-pages/pyguide.md#38-comments-and-docstrings, added 
  to all functions. This is the first iteration of in-line documention that will need refining.
* Refactored loops in startup.py.
* `Black` formatter applied across all python files.
* Remove redundant param_dict from data_harvest()
* Remove redundant imports from common.py
* Remove redundant `interpkind` var from interpolate_extraction_lims and related functions
* Remove redudnant variable declaration `wav_min = scihead["CRVAL1"]` from harvester.py
* Import order of modules to conform to PEP8.
* Instances of exit() to sys.exit() to conform to PEP8.
* Updated link in CHANGELOG.md

## 0.4.1 2023-02-15
Updated by D. Kiersz

### Added
* Installation environment for Anaconda and dependencies with instructions. This is the first step 
  for contenarising the application.

### Changed
* Updated README.md, including a spelling mistake.
* In Removed the following line 
  `sys.stdout.write('     Extraction of ' + direc + ' could not be completed.\n')`.
* In `startup.py` use a list-comprehension instead of a loop.

## 0.4.0 2022-07-27
Updates by T. Seccull

### Added
- An optimal extraction routine developed by Dominik Kiersz has now been fully integrated into 
  MOTES. Some changes have been made to the original design by TS to increase the efficiency of the 
  process, and ensure that is compatible with data from multiple instruments. It still operates on 
  the original fundamental principles developed by DAK, however. MOTES now produces both aperture, 
  and optimally extracted spectra by default.

### Changed
- The comments related to many functions have been updated to more clearly describe their inputs, 
  outputs, and purpose. This work is ongoing along with removing deprecated sections of code.
- The GMOS harvester function has been updated to handle the detector chip gaps more efficiently.
- There have been multiple changes to how the extraction limits are defined to account for the new 
  optimal extraction routine. The main one being that the data is no longer supersampled prior to 
  being extracted in the aperture method.  

## 0.3.0 2022-04-06
Updates by T. Seccull

### Added
- Harvester function has been added for the FLOYDS spectrographs on the Las Cumbres Observatory 2 m 
  telescopes.

### Changed
- Astroscrappy has been run on the GMOS demo data to remove cosmic rays.
- Demo data has been removed from the github repository for now as the GMOS frames are too large. 
  Return of the FORS2 and X-Shooter demo data frames to the repository should be fine in the near 
  future.

### Deprecated
- All cosmic ray handling functions and lines have been commented out pending removal. This is 
  because there are much better software tools, (e.g. Astroscrappy) that can be used for removing 
  and replacing cosmic rays. Testing of the software on the demo data shows that it is fully 
  functional without the cosmic ray handling sections. These regions will need to be tidied up.


## 0.2.1Â 2021-03-26

### Changed
- Colormap for plots updated to inferno. Using a perceptually uniform sequential colormap really 
  makes a difference in clearly defining structure in the spectrum.

## 0.2.0 - 2021-03-19
Updates by T. Seccull

### Changed
- Simplified the way the GMOS harvester handles incoming qual frame and converts it so good 
  pixels=1 and bad pixels=0, while ensuring the chip gaps aren't flagged as bad pixels.
- Overhauled cosmic ray handling so CRs and badpixels can be replaced by the input quality frame 
  alone without the need for motes to use its, frankly piss-poor, CR detection routine. If software 
  like astroscrappy is used to create a cosmic ray mask, it needs to be combined with the 
  spectrogram's input quality mask for motes to recognise the detected CRs as bad.
- In `motesparams.txt`, the `-MASK_CR` keyword is now `-IDENT_CR` and is specifically used to refer 
  to the motes CR identification routine independently of the `-REPLACE_CR` keyword. Setting either 
  `-IDENT_CR` or `-REPLACE_CR` to True (1) results in an updated `cr_handlin()` function in 
  `motes.py` being called.

### Fixed
- Fixed incorrect header parameter dictionary call in `save_fits()` when recording the wavelength 
  unit to the header of the output file.
- When determining datascale in `motes()`, the base 10 log of the absolute value of the median 
  collapsed profile is now calculated. Previously this would fail if the median value turned out to 
  be negative.
- Fixed outdated method of calling `common.get_bins_output()` in the case where CR masking is not 
  done. This has now been updated in line with other calls to this function from `motes()`.
- Fixed a bug where cosmic ray replacement would completely fail on spatial pixel columns with no 
  valid data (e.g. all nans or zeros), and would wrongly propagate bad pixel flags to adjacent 
  columns with good data. `common.get_bins()` now simply ignores columns with all bad data, as they 
  are pretty much unrecoverable. 

## 0.1.1 - 2021-03-04
Updates by T. Seccull

### Changed
- Updated wording of python compatibility in `README.md`.

### Removed
- Unused lines related to marking the chip gaps in GMOS spectra with NaNs.


## 0.1.0 - 2021-03-03
Updates by T. Seccull

#### The Dark Ages
The majority of this package was written by Tom Seccull during his PhD at Queen's University 
Belfast from 2015-2019, under the tutelage of Wes Fraser (at HIA Victoria, BC, at time of writing). 
The process was messy, haphazard, and initially documented only within the fuzzy mind of the lead 
developer (needless to say better practices have been adopted since then). For much of its 
development MOTES was known as GME (the Grand Moff Extractor); the current name has been selected 
to better represent the function of the package and increase its accessibility to new users. Since 
March 2020 the primary source of documentation for this software has been Chapter 3 of Seccull's 
PhD Thesis titled ["Revealing Refractory Materials on Trans-Neptunian Objects and Centaurs via 
Reflectance Spectroscopy"](https://pure.qub.ac.uk/en/studentTheses/revealing-refractory-materials-on-trans-neptunian-objects-and-cen).
The thesis text will be released from embargo in the summer of 2022, but better documentation for 
MOTES is expected to be provided before then. All changes listed here relay developments to MOTES 
following 2021-03-01.

### Added
- This changelog.
- `if name == main:` has been introduced to `motes.py` so the MOTES functions may be called within 
  another python script, or within a python session.
- Demo data for FORS2, GMOS, and X-Shooter, all bright targets.
- Scale bars on the figures now allow users to adjust the cut in the plotted images.

### Changed
- The entire package has been made modular and processes all spectra from different instruments in 
  the same way. The process generally follows that defined for X-Shooter spectra in GME.
- `harvester.py` has been created (modified from the version that handled FORS2 spectra) and is 
  capable of unpacking data and relevant FITS header parameters from any FITS formatted 
  spectrogram. `data_harvest()` calls a more specialised harvester function depending on which 
  instrument a spectrogram has come from. `harvester.py` has been designed to allow the development 
  and inclusion of new specialised harvester functions for other instruments that can extract and 
  convert the relevant data from other instruments into a format that MOTES can process.
- Functions `readparfile()` and `readregions()`, which respectively read `motesparams.txt` and 
  `reg.txt` have been moved to their own module called `startup.py`.
- Controls for how the data frames are initially sliced have been removed from `motesparams.txt` 
  entirely; instead the user must define the number of rows to remove from the spatial axis of the 
  spectrum, and the wavelength range of the spectrum for each input file in `reg.txt`
- `motesparams.txt` must now be present in the same directory as the input data files. This has been 
  done to minimise the need to change the parameters for different setups between testing runs. It 
  should also make life easier for users who may be using MOTES with multiple datasets requiring 
  different parameters.
- The main script that was `forsextraction() or `xshooextraction()` has been incorporated into 
  `motes.py`. The `motes()` function is now the main function of the package. Sky subtraction 
  processes and cosmic ray handling have respectively been moved to their own functions within 
  `motes.py`; this is to reflect the fact that they are optional and are not required for motes to 
  run.
- Small rearrangements in the order of the output file header metadata have been done.
- Data frames are now almost always stored in a dedicated dictionary referred to as framedict or 
  some similar name depending on which function it's called from.
- Similarly to data frames, axes and parameters related to them are stored in axesdict or similar.
- All references to GME changed to MOTES; this includes references within the Python scripts 
  themselves and within comments.
- Version number has been dropped from v0.9.0 to v0.1.0, to better reflect reality (I'm also dumb 
  and should have read up on semantic versioning before sticking a number on this, ha!).
- Output frames like skymod, skybins, skyextractionlims and crmask are only added to the frame 
  dictionary if those sections of code are run. This may fix a bug where spectrograms that are 
  already skysubtracted are extracted but error out during saving.
- Output files from MOTES are prepended with 'm' rather than having '_GME_' included in the middle 
  of the filename.
- MOTES no longer walks through an ESO-like directory tree to find input files. All input FITS 
  files are expected to be present in the current working directory, and ordered in the same way as 
  their associated regions in `reg.txt`.
