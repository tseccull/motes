# MOTES: a Modular, Optimised Tracer and Extractor of Spectra 

Version: 0.1.2_dev

Last Updated: 2021-03-04 - T. Seccull

Developers: Tom Seccull (Lead) & Dominik Kiersz

MOTES is a Python package used for tracing and extracting spectra of faint 
astronomical point sources from 2D spectrograms. MOTES is also capable of sky 
subtraction and cosmic ray masking and subsequent rejection.

# Project Status
Currently in final stages of development toward v1.0 and release. Updates and 
inclusion of optimal extraction capability are to be included in the near 
future. Documentation is still to be written, as well as an accompanying article 
that will likely be submitted to one of the AAS journals.

This development branch is setup to transfer relevant functions to 

# Installation
Python 3 is recommended for running MOTES. It is compatible with Python 2.7, but is also noticably slower.

For dependencies, installing an Anaconda enviroment from a .yml file will most likely suffice. I've uploaded one as an example and the following command can install the enviroment locally.

conda env create --name motes --file=motes.yml

The rest of this sections needs to be worked out.
