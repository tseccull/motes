# MOTES: a Modular, Optimised Tracer and Extractor of Spectra 
version 0.2.0

Last Updated: 2021-03-19 - T. Seccull

Developers: Tom Seccull & Dominik Kiersz

MOTES is a python package used for tracing and extracting spectra of faint 
astronomical point sources from 2D spectrograms. MOTES is also capable of sky 
subtraction and cosmic ray rejection/masking. 

Citation: Please cite .... paper to be written .... if you use MOTES in your 
research. Need a Zenodo DOI?

# Project Status
Currently in final stages of development toward v1.0 and release. Updates and 
inclusion of optimal extraction capability are to be included in the near 
future. Documentation is still to be written, as well as an accompanying article 
that will likely be submitted to one of the AAS journals.

# Installation
Python 3 is recommended for running MOTES. It is compatible with Python 2.7, but is also noticably slower.

The rest of this needs to be worked out...

Dependencies: etc.
